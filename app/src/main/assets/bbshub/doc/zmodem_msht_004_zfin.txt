   ZFIN End of Session

   Sent after the last file is transferred, the server ZFIN End of Session
   packet marks the end of a session and is echoed back by the client.

   The ZFIN End of Session packet has a fixed format:

 <PAD> <PAD>
 <ZDLE> 42 30 38 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 30 32 32 64
 <CR> <LF>

           PadChars (2 bytes): Pad characters.

           Value          Meaning
           0x2A2A Repeated pad character.

           StartofPacket (1 byte): Packet start character.

           Value       Meaning
           0x18  ZDLE: Packet start.

           FormatType (1 byte): Type of header format.

           Value                           Meaning
           0x42  Denotes that the PacketType and EndOfSessionData fields are
                 in Zmodem hex format.

           PacketType (1 byte): Type of packet.

           Value      Meaning
           ZEOF   End of session.
           0x3038

           EndOfSessionData (1 byte): Marks the end of session.

                         Value                   Meaning
           0x303030303030303030323264<CR><LF> End of session

   Both a line control sequence and an escape sequence consist of the ZDLE
   character (0x18) followed by a single character. A line control sequence
   is a command sent as a character outside the regular packet structure. An
   escape sequence allows the receiver to ignore the character following the
   ZDLE character.

   Value                   Description
   0x180D                  Ignored by receiver.
   0x1810                  Ignored by receiver.
   0x1811                  Ignored by receiver.
   0x1813                  Ignored by receiver.
   0x1868 (ZDLE + ASCII h) ZCRCE : CRC next, packet ends, header packet
                           follows.
   0x1869 (ZDLE + ASCII i) ZCRCG: CRC next, packet continues nonstop.
   0x186A (ZDLE + ASCII j) ZCRCQ: CRC next, packet continues, ZACK expected.
   0x186B (ZDLE + ASCII k) ZCRCW: CRC next, ZACK expected, end of packet.
   0x186C (ZDLE + ASCII l) ZRUB0: Translate to rubout 0177.
   0x186D (ZDLE + ASCII m) ZRUB1: Translate to rubout 0377.
