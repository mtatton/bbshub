   ZEOF End of File

   The server ZEOF End of File packet marks the end of a file transfer. It is
   preceded by one or more server ZDATA packets and a server ZCRCE escape
   sequence, none of which are acknowledged by the client. The client
   acknowledges this packet with a ZRINIT packet. The client ZRINIT packet
   indicates that the client is ready to receive the next file transfer, if
   any.

   Line control and escape sequences

   --------------------------------------------------------------------------

   Both a line control sequence and an escape sequence consist of the ZDLE
   character (0x18) followed by a single character. A line control sequence
   is a command sent as a character outside the regular packet structure. An
   escape sequence allows the receiver to ignore the character following the
   ZDLE character.
